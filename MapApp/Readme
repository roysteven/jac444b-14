1. After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again. I've checked that there's no compilation error.

2. Instructions of running the application on Eclipse:

  1)Create a Java Project on Eclipse
     The location is any on the local machine, such as c:\temp\MapApp

  3)Open the src folder in the project on Eclipse

  4)Find the file MapApp.java in the package "mapapp"

  5)Run MapApp.java (right click --> choose Run as --> choose Java Application )

3. List of jar files 
    We haven't used third-party Java packages.

4. All original source code are come from
        http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/10/30/building-maps-into-swing-app-with-jxmapviewer.html
   Our team works on modifying MapView.java file in order to add new UI components and functions which
   expand the functions of this project(MapApp).  

   Modify content:
         UI: 1. Add one drop down list(JComoBox) for quick input location and restore the inputed location as the history inputting history
              2. Add one text field for inputting location through keyboard
              3. Add two buttons for zoom in map and zoom out map
         Function: 1. Get google map through inputting location(Such as "London, UK")
                        2. Zoom In and Zoom Out
                        3. Restore the location accessing history into drop down list in JComboBox

5. For the package gglMpsSttcAccessor 
    - Using the theory of module called Provider.GoogleStatic in APPLICATION1:
    - Our assignment implements the similar feather getting local information from google static map by using its API with its geocoding interface.
    - It is base on assignment's special need that it provides an interface to end user to location an address by typing the address in cognitive 
      address such as "234 holmbush crescent toronto","toronto ca" and so on, instead of the longitude and latitude. So that the end user could
      locate anywhere he/she want.
